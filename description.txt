Simulation Methodology:
In order to test the ALU, we separately tested the individual components of the ALU and the ALU unit as a whole. For each unit, we tested the basic 0, 1, -1 and the upper limit. In addition to spot checking various inputs between the boundaries, we identified corner cases in each modules and thoroughly tested each of them. When testing the ALU as a whole, we used a variety of values for the operands X and Y, and looped over the opcodes and compared actual outputs to the expected outputs. In addition to varying op codes, we lightly varied the inputs to test the output flags. We focused our attention on extensively testing the components of the ALU rather than the ALU itself. We feel that more fleshed out components will provide a more stable design. The more robust lower level testing should provide us the luxury to write more basic ALU level testing.
